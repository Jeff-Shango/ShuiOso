        <p>
          DJ Candikrush began her career at the tender age of 12, being
          inspired and trained by legends like Grand Wizard Theodore and DJ
          Jimmyphingaz of Washington DC and New York.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candace has been an established DJ for decades — opening for Kurtis
          Blow, touring with the No Profanity Tours, DJing for Adidas, and
          appearing on radio stations both locally and internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is seasoned in many genres of the music industry — from House
