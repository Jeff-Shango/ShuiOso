Shui Oso is an emerging open-format DJ and music producer based in Baltimore, blending a fighter's focus with a curator's ear. After years of competing in Boxing, Kickboxing, Jiu Jitsu, and MMA, he's shifted that same discipline into his love for music-using DJing as a new arena to channel energy in entertaining a crowd. 

Rooted in Baltimore club culture and raised on legends like KW Griff, K-Swift (R.I.P), and the 92Q crew as a whole, Shui Oso brings a deep appreciation for genre-mixing, rhythm, and raw emotion. 

Sets from Shui Oso often feature his own original productions and remixes, keeping things fresh, unpredictable, and personal. Whether spining house, hip-hop, club, or anything in between, Shui's mission is simple: Keep the world Dancing!
